      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Byte‑Sized Brains is a passion project designed to give you a quick
        mental workout every day.  We believe that keeping your mind active
        shouldn’t require a huge time investment.  Our micro‑challenges take
        only a few minutes to complete, but they spark curiosity and build
        mental agility.

        This site is also an experiment in creating sustainable digital
        businesses.  High‑quality content sites attract loyal readers who return
        regularly, and forums or support groups build vibrant communities.  We
        use advertising to support the free version of the site; ad networks
        suggest that sites in popular niches can earn anywhere from \$1,000 to
        over \$50,000 per month depending on traffic and optimization.  Over
        time, we plan to offer a premium tier without ads and with additional
        analytics and challenge archives.

        If you’d like to extend this prototype, head over to the project
        repository and modify the puzzle list in <code>script.js</code>.  You can
        deploy the static files on services like Netlify or GitHub Pages, or
        integrate a back‑end to support user accounts, AI‑generated puzzles and
        real advertising.  We hope this inspires you to create your own
        micro‑content business!
